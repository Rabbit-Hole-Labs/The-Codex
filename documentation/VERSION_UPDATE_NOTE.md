# Version Increment Note

The manifest.json file needs to be updated to reflect the new version number "7.0.0.2".

Current version in manifest.json: "7.0.0.1"
Required version: "7.0.0.2"

This change should be made by a developer in code mode as the architect mode can only edit Markdown files.

The CHANGELOG.md file has already been updated to reflect this version increment.
